   this will install the dependencies that exist in the package.json file 

if you prefer to open the project from github you can make a git clone from this link: https://github.com/yazanateer/rooms-app



4- to run the project, run the following command:
    npm run start

because we use three mini apps each one in a differnet web page, so every mini app run on different PORT , this miniapp run on PORT:3002
if it doesnt work because using a differnt system ( not using the windows system) you must change in:
package.json: line 16 - script -> start -> "start": "react-scripts start",
